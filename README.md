 Full Stack Development I 2024

 Architecture
In this project, Angular was used for a Single-Page Application (SPA) to enhance user experience with dynamic, asynchronous content loading, unlike the traditional Express HTML approach, which reloads the entire page. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility and scalability, handling diverse data structures efficiently compared to rigid SQL schemas.

Functionality
JSON is a lightweight format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, distinct from JavaScript itself. It ensures seamless communication by structuring data in a readable format. Refactoring into reusable Angular components streamlined development, improved efficiency, and maintained consistency across the application.

Testing
Testing methods for API endpoints include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, focusing on functionality and security. Testing security features like JWT authentication requires careful handling of tokens and environment setups to ensure robust security without compromising functionality.

Reflection
This course has advanced my skills in full stack development, particularly with the MEAN stack and secure authentication. These skills enhance my marketability and readiness for complex development challenges in the tech industry.
